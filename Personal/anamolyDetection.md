# Anomaly Detection


This document summarizes the key points and findings from the `anamolyDetection.ipynb` notebook, which demonstrates advanced anomaly detection for cybersecurity using Isolation Forest.

## Overview


Anomaly detection involves identifying data points, events, or observations that deviate significantly from the norm. This notebook demonstrates anomaly detection using the Isolation Forest algorithm, which is well-suited for cybersecurity applications such as detecting unusual network traffic, login attempts, or system events. The approach is demonstrated on a synthetic dataset simulating cybersecurity events.


## Dataset

- **Source**: The data is synthetically generated using NumPy to simulate cybersecurity events (e.g., network traffic, login attempts).
- **Description**: 300 data points with two features. 10% of the data points are generated as anomalies (outliers), simulating rare or suspicious events.
- **Features**: Two numerical features, e.g., 'bytes sent' and 'login duration'.


## Methodology

1. **Data Generation**: Synthetic data is created to simulate normal and anomalous cybersecurity events.

2. **Modeling**:
   - **Algorithm used**: Isolation Forest from scikit-learn.
   - **Evaluation metric**: The number of detected anomalies (outliers) and visual inspection of the decision boundary.

3. **Visualization**: The results are visualized in 2D, showing the decision boundary, normal points, and anomalies. The plot uses color coding and a legend for clarity.


## Results

- **Model**: Isolation Forest.
- **Performance**: The model detects anomalies in the synthetic cybersecurity dataset. The number of detected anomalies is printed, and the decision boundary is visualized. Normal events and anomalies are clearly separated in the plot.


## Conclusion

The anomaly detection model using Isolation Forest was successfully applied to a synthetic cybersecurity dataset. The model's decision boundary was visualized, showing clear separation between normal and anomalous events. The number of detected anomalies is reported. For real-world applications, further evaluation using metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-score is recommended, along with the use of real labeled cybersecurity data.
