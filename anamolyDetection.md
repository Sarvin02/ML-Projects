# Anomaly Detection

This document summarizes the key points and findings from the `anamolyDetection.ipynb` notebook.

## Overview
Anomaly detection involves identifying data points, events, or observations that deviate significantly from the norm. This technique is widely used in various domains such as fraud detection, network security, and predictive maintenance.

## Dataset
